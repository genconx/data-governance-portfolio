# Data Governance & Stewardship Portfolio

This portfolio demonstrates practical data governance and data stewardship capabilities using a realistic operational dataset from a martial arts school membership context. The work emphasizes data quality assessment, authoritative standards, governance controls, and accountability structures rather than advanced analytics or modeling.

The goal of this portfolio is to show how trustworthy, decision-ready data is created and maintained in real-world operational environments.

## Project 1 — Data Quality Assessment

**Objective:**  
Evaluate the reliability of membership, attendance, and billing data and identify risks to operational and financial reporting.

**What was done:**
- Defined data quality rules across completeness, validity, uniqueness, and business constraints
- Executed non-destructive data quality checks using Excel Power Query (Mac)
- Quantified violations with counts and percentages
- Documented findings and business risk
- Produced a remediation plan with owners, priorities, and timelines

**Key Artifacts:**
- Data Quality Rules & Results: `docs/data_quality_rules.md`
- Data Quality Summary & Risk Narrative: `docs/data_quality_summary.md`
- Remediation Plan: `docs/data_quality_remediation_plan.md`
- Evidence Screenshots: `outputs/`

## Project 2 — Data Standards, Rules, and Ownership

**Objective:**  
Establish authoritative definitions, enforceable business rules, and clear ownership to prevent recurring data quality issues.

**What was done:**
- Defined authoritative data standards with allowed values and ownership
- Created enforceable business rules mapped to quality issues
- Assigned data ownership and decision rights using a RACI model

**Key Artifacts:**
- Data Dictionary & Standards: `docs/data_dictionary.md`
- Business Rules & Controls: `docs/data_business_rules_and_controls.md`
- Data Ownership & RACI: `docs/data_ownership_raci.md`

## Tools & Methods
- Excel Power Query (Mac) for profiling and rule-based checks
- GitHub for version control and auditability
- Markdown documentation for governance artifacts

---

## Key Takeaways
- Data quality issues are operational and governance problems, not just technical ones
- Preventive standards and ownership reduce long-term risk more effectively than cleanup
- Clear documentation and accountability are critical for trustworthy reporting

## About This Portfolio
All data used is synthetic and anonymized, intentionally seeded with realistic quality issues to demonstrate detection, documentation, and governance controls.
