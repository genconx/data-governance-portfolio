# Data Governance & Stewardship Portfolio

This repository demonstrates practical data governance and data stewardship skills, including:

The projects use anonymized operational data and focus on decision-ready, trustworthy data rather than advanced modeling.

## Structure
- data/raw: Original, untouched source data
- data/processed: Cleaned and standardized data
- docs: Data dictionaries, quality rules, and assumptions
- outputs: Summary tables, charts, and screenshots

## Tools
- Excel / SQL / Python (as applicable)
